# FriendBase

## App Idea Origin
I origininally created this app to complete the challenge for Day 60/61 in Paul Hudson's free online 100DaysOfSwiftUI course. However, I later decided to take this project further as I acquired more SwiftUI skills.

PS: No coding solutions were provided for this app so the entire implementation was on my own besides a few tips given by the challenge guidelines. The challenge required me to create an app that fetches data from a [Sample API Call](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/samples/friendface.json), if possible, to update the information stored in CoreData, which is then displayed through a Navigation View. Full challenge guidelines can be found at [Day 60](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/5/3/challenge) and [Day 61](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/61).
